# Etcetera
<p>SinhaLearn was a fun project I decided to take on in order to dip my feet into Android and React-Native development, and to share my language with others.

I was able to create a working app, which uses a real-time database via Firebase to retrieve structured flashcard data. From there I can add and configure lessons and flashcards on the fly, 
instead of having to upload a new build to the Play store each time. You may notice some of the later lessons are empty, as I haven't found the time to finish writing them.

I tried my best to create an accessible design with few colors and hopefully good readability. Hope you enjoy!
